## Changes in v1.4.6

- **Fix:** Resolved "Cannot find module @polar-sh/sdk" error when opening the app (packaged builds).
- Unsigned builds (zip/DMG) and signed DMG for in-app updates.

---

**Recommended:** Download **Jarvis-6.0-1.4.6-SIGNED.dmg** from Assets for the best install experience.

**If in-app update gets stuck at "Installing...":** Quit Jarvis, then download the signed DMG from the Assets below and open it to install. Your settings and data are preserved.
