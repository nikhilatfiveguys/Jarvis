## Changes in v1.4.3

### Bug Fixes

- **Update check** – Fixed "Update check failed: Cannot find latest artifacts" (404 on mac.yml).
  - In-app updater now uses an explicit GitHub releases URL so the correct repo is always used.
  - Release workflow now generates and uploads update metadata (e.g. `latest-mac.yml`) so the updater can find the latest version.

### From v1.4.2

- OpenRouter Models Window – Browse and add AI models from OpenRouter in a dedicated window.
- Your added models – See all models in your "More models" list in one place in the OpenRouter window.
- Multiple models – Adding more models from OpenRouter no longer removes previously added models.
- More models source of truth – Overlay "More models" section stays in sync with the OpenRouter window.

### From v1.4.1

- Browser-based Voice Recording – Works without installing sox or any external tools.
- Fixed recording cancel button (X) being click-through.
- Improved voice recording error messages and overlay toggle responsiveness.

Note: This DMG is signed for smooth installation. Users on v1.4.1 or earlier will receive an automatic update prompt.
