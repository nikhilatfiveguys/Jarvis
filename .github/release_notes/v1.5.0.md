## Changes in v1.5.0

- **In-app browser:** Links you click in the overlay (e.g. from AI responses) now open in a custom in-app browser tab instead of your system browser. The browser has a dark tab bar, slanted tab with rounded top corners, and toolbar (back, forward, refresh, address bar, site info, translate).
- Release 1.5.0 for in-app updates.

**In-app update:** If you have Jarvis installed, use **Check for updates** in the app to get 1.5.0. You can also download the signed DMG or zip from Assets and replace your app.
