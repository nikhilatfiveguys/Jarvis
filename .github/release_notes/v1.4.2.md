## Changes in v1.4.2

### New Features

- **OpenRouter Models Window** – Browse and add AI models from OpenRouter in a dedicated window (like the Account window).
  - "Browse more models" opens the OpenRouter models window
  - Search and filter (e.g. free models only) to find models
  - Click "Add" to add a model to your overlay "More models" list

- **Your added models** – In the OpenRouter window, see all models in your "More models" list in one place.
  - Shows default models (Claude Opus 4.5, DeepSeek V3, Llama 4 Maverick, Kimi K2 Thinking) plus any you added from OpenRouter
  - Remove any model with the "Remove" button; it disappears from the overlay dropdown and from this list

### Bug Fixes

- **Multiple models** – Adding a second (or more) model from the OpenRouter window no longer removes previously added models; all added models are kept.
- **More models source of truth** – The overlay "More models" section is now populated from a single list (defaults + your additions), so it stays in sync with the OpenRouter window.
